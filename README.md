Hi, I'm Princeton. I've been passionate about various technologies since my childhood, and I geek out a lot about anything related to space. I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics. Since then, I've worked for two multinational companies as an API Developer using the Axway API Gateway product. Currently, I have 5.5 years of professional experience, and my current career enhancement goals include learning DevOps and Data Analytics.
