My favorite place that I have visited is Goa, India. It is a beautiful state with beaches where you can witness amazing sunsets, great food, and more. There are two primary reasons that I like to visit the most. They are the Basilica of Bom Jesus, where the mortal remains of Saint Francis Xavier lie, and the delicious Pork Sausages.
