My favorite place that I have visited is Goa, India. It is a beautiful state with beaches where you can witness amazing sunsets, great food, and more.

There are two primary reasons that I like to visit the most. They are the Basilica of Bom Jesus, where the mortal remains of Saint Francis Xavier lie, and the delicious Pork Sausages. 

Because my ancestors are from this region, it helps me connect with my past and learn more about my family lineage.

I have visited this place many times in my life until now, but I can't get bored of it. I am planning to visit this place multiple times even now.
